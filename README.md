# Module 3 Capstone - National Park Geek #

For Tech Elevator's Module 3 capstone project, I teamed with two of my classmates (Deborah and Mohammad) to create a dynamic web project called National Park Geek. The web site allows users to find information on various national parks, check the upcoming weather forecast for each park, and take a short survey. 

Technologies used in the project include Java, Spring Web MVC, JSTL, JSP EL, PostgreSQL, HTML/CSS, JUnit, Selenium, and Cucumber. My contributions to the project include writing a portion of the controller, writing multiple views, adding functionality to the Weather model, writing multiple unit and Cucumber tests, and general debugging/troubleshooting.
